    <title>hay is learning to make a website</title>

    <p>started 12 feb 2026</p>

    <p> the last time i made a website i was 13 or 14, and i was motivated by (a) having to do it for dt class and (b) wanted to edit my tumblr page. since then i've been a casual admirer of opensource and indie web movements, but have not really had the space to explore these in more detail. i'm currently doing an mphil in digital humanities (don't ask me to define what that means) and i'm researching internet art preservation in asia. it feels like it's time to go back to fundamentals, and to figure out how to build a website from scratch in ways that feel legible to me.</p>

    <p>this website is built off of github pages, on github for desktop. it currently uses html only. i am following the <a href="https://handmade-web.net/spring26/index.html">Handmade Web</a> course at virginia commonwealth university, and this section comes from the <a href="https://handmade-web.net/exercises/homepage.html">Homepage</a> exercise. </p>
