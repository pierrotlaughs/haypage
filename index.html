<h1>hay is learning to make a website</h1>
<p> started 12 feb 2026
    the last time i made a website i was 13 or 14, and i was motivated by (a) having to do it for dt class and (b) wanted to edit my tumblr page. now i'm a mphil digital humantiies student and it feels like it's time to relearn these skills, if only on a basic level.

    this website is built off of github pages, on github for desktop. it currently uses html only. i am following the <a href="https://handmade-web.net/spring26/index.html">Handmade Web</a> course at virginia commonwealth university, and this section comes from the <a href="<a href="https://handmade-web.net/exercises/homepage.html">Homepage</a> exercise.
